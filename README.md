## Finding Similar Faces with DeepFace

This code snippet demonstrates how to use the `DeepFace` library to find similar faces in a collection of images. The code compares a target image with a set of reference images and ranks them based on their similarity.

### Prerequisites
- `deepface` library: You need to install the `deepface` library to run this code. You can install it using pip:
  ```
  pip install deepface
  ```

### Code Explanation

1. Importing the required libraries:
   ```python
   from deepface import DeepFace
   import os
   import pandas as pd
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import cv2
   ```

2. Setting up the paths and variables:
   ```python
    compare_path = ""  # Path to the directory containing reference images
   
    compare_characters = os.listdir(compare_path)  # List all files in the directory
   
    img_path = ""  # Path to the target image for comparison
   ```
   
3. Calling the function with target image path:
    ```python 
    res = finding_similar_face_function(img_path)
    ```

The function `finding_similar_face_function()` iterates through each reference image and compares it with the target image using `DeepFace.verify()`. It uses "Facenet" as face recognition model and "mtcnn" as face detection backend.

After comparing all images, it visualizes bounding boxes around detected faces in both images using OpenCV (`cv2`). It then ranks reference images based on their similarity distance and prints out name of most similar person along with ranking list.

Note: Make sure to replace empty strings (`""`) with appropriate file paths before running this code.
